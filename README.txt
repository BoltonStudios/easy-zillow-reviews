For example: https://www.zillow.com/profile/**my-screenname**/

**Important**: See [Zillow's Review API FAQ](https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/faq.htm). *Easy Zillow Reviews* is compliant out-of-the-box but please note the following limitations before you adjust settings or request support:

* No local storage of reviews. *Easy Zillow Reviews* will always fetch the latest reviews directly from Zillow's Reviews API using your ZWSID or ZPID.
* No more more than 1,000 calls to the Reviews API in a day, and no more than 20 on one page at one time. *Easy Zillow Reviews* will display a simple text error message to help identify the problem if your ZWSID or ZPID is blocked for any reason. Zillow may permit more calls for your account upon request. Per the FAQ, you may reach out to <huann@zillow.com> or <reviewsapi@zillow.com> for more info.
* Include the approved Zillow logo on your website wherever reviews appear. *Easy Zillow Reviews* includes this logo but you can disable it in Settings > Easy Zillow Reviews if you wish to add it elsewhere adjacent to the Reviews per the [Branding Guidelines](https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/BrandingRequirements.htm).
* Include the Mandatory Disclaimer wherever reviews appear. *Easy Zillow Reviews* includes this disclaimer but you can disable it in Settings > Easy Zillow Reviews if you wish to add it elsewhere (such as in the footer).
